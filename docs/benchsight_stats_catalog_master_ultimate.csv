TOI (e.g., Goals/60)."
BS02,Assists (Primary + Secondary),,player_game,Basic,"Total number of assists a player records in a game, both primary and secondary.",,"Count of events flagged as goals where assist_1_id = player_id OR assist_2_id = player_id, wired via
play_details_1/play_details_2 or explicit assist columns, depending on actual implementation.",,,,,,,Yes,,,,"Make sure the model understands that a player can get at most 2 assists per goal event (primary + secondary).
If schemas differ, rely on whatever columns are explicitly marked as assists."
BS03,Points,,player_game,Basic,Sum of goals and assists a player records in a game.,,Points = Goals + Assists.,,,,,,,Yes,,,,"Treat this as a composite stat and do not double-count goals. If computing from events instead of boxscore,
first compute BS01 and BS02, then add."

player's team AND the player is on the ice according to shifts_long or the on-ice join; then count these.",,,,,,,Yes,,,,"This is the core 'Corsi For' input. The model should remember this is an on-ice stat, not purely 'player did
the shot'. It reflects team shot volume with that player."

exits.",,"ExitSuccessRate = successful_exits / total_exits, where each exit is an event with type IN ('zone_exit') and
success is encoded in event_successful or play_successful and additional details for with-possession vs
rims/clears.",,,,,,,Partial,Needs clear tagging of exit events and success conditions in the tracking template.,,,"LLM should note that not all 'exits' are of equal quality. If more detail exists in play_detail fields (e.g.,
with-control vs without-control), propose separate metrics for each."
BS18,Controlled Breakout Rate,,team_game,Microstat,Percentage of defensive-zone exits that lead to controlled possession through the neutral zone.,,"ControlledBreakoutRate = controlled_exits / total_exits, where controlled_exits are those tagged as with-
possession and may be followed by a controlled neutral-zone carry or pass.",,,,,,,Partial,Requires sequence/chain modeling across events: must know that an exit and subsequent events belong to the same sequence.,,,"Recommend implementing sequences that span DZ → NZ → OZ using the existing sequence_index or play_index.

transition through multiple zones.",,"RushChance is typically defined as a shot or high-danger chance that occurs within N seconds of a controlled
zone entry or multi-zone carry. Count such events for which the player is either shooter (event_player_1) or
primary passer (event_player_2).",,,,,,,No,"Requires (1) time-aware sequence modeling, (2) speed or at least start/end zone timestamps, (3) shot categorization as 'chance' vs 'simple shot'. These are not fully implemented yet.",,,"LLM should flag this stat as 'planned but not fully implemented'. It can describe how to compute it logically

exiting the offensive zone.",,"Define a cycle as a sequence of events where the puck stays in OZ, there are >= N successful passes among
teammates, and no zone exit occurs before the sequence ends. Count these per team.",,,,,,,No,Needs robust possession + zone modeling and a clear rule for 'cycle' vs 'simple OZ touch'.,,,"LLM can propose logic and feature-engineering steps but should mark actual metric as not yet implemented
unless cycle classification columns exist."
BS21,With-You vs Without-You GF%,,pair_or_line_game,Impact,Comparative GF% when a player is on the ice with a specific teammate vs when that teammate is off.,,"For a pair (A,B): GF%_with = GF_with / (GF_with + GA_with) in minutes where both on ice; GF%_without =
GF_without / (GF_without + GA_without) where A is on ice and B is not. The difference reflects synergy or
dependency.",,,,,,,Partial,Needs robust on-ice combination tables (line/pair IDs) and enough samples per pair.,,,"LLM should caution about small-sample noise and propose usage thresholds. For large combinatorics, suggest
pre-aggregated 'fact_line_onice' tables."

B.",,"xGF_H2H(A vs B) = sum of xG for shots by A's team when both A and B are on the ice, minus xGA_H2H, similar to
CF-style on-ice logic but restricted to overlapping TOI for those two players.",,,,,,,Partial,"As with xG stats, must have xG values per shot and accurate on-ice tables. Also needs efficient pair indexing for on-ice overlap.",,,"LLM should treat this as an advanced H2H view. If xG is unavailable, fallback to shot attempts or goals in the
same on-ice windows."
BS23,Puck Touches / Possession Events,,player_game,Microstat,"Number of times a player directly controls the puck (touches, carries, receptions).",,"Count events where event_detail_1 or play_detail_1 indicate 'puck_touch', 'receive_pass', 'carry', or similar

this stat."
BS26,Faceoff Win %,,player_game,Basic,Percentage of faceoffs a player takes that they win.,,"FO% = faceoff_wins / (faceoff_wins + faceoff_losses), where a 'win' is indicated by event_player_1 for faceoff

player_id of (event_end_time - event_start_time) in seconds.",,,,,,,Partial,Requires event_start and event_end timestamps for possession-type events.,,,"When those timestamps exist, the LLM can compute per-player and per-zone possession time. If not, mark as
conceptual-only."

## Version Alignment

### Current Versions
- **STRATEGIC_ROADMAP.md:** v29.0 (Last updated: 2026-01-13)
- **ROADMAP.md:** v24.4 (Last updated: 2026-01-12)
- **STRATEGIC_ASSESSMENT.md:** v29.0 (Last updated: 2026-01-13)

### Version Note
The documents use different version numbers because they serve different purposes and have different update cycles. This is intentional:

- **ROADMAP** = Technical, detailed (monthly updates)
- **STRATEGIC_ASSESSMENT** = Assessment snapshot (quarterly updates)

## Roadmap Structure Overview

### STRATEGIC_ROADMAP.md Structure
```
Phase 1: Integration (Weeks 1-4)    → End-to-end workflow
Phase 2: Dashboard (Weeks 5-8)     → Public-facing product
Phase 3: ML/CV (Weeks 9-12)        → Automated tracking
Phase 4: Commercial (Weeks 13-16)  → Multi-tenant SaaS
```

### ROADMAP.md Structure
```
Phase 0: Foundation (Done)
Phase 0.5: Validation (Done)

## Questions?

- **Which roadmap is the "real" one?** Both serve different purposes. Use STRATEGIC_ROADMAP for high-level planning, ROADMAP for technical details.
- **Why different version numbers?** Different update cycles and purposes. This is intentional.
- **Which one should I update?** Depends on what changed. Strategic changes → STRATEGIC_ROADMAP, Technical changes → ROADMAP.
- **Should we consolidate?** See PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_ENHANCEMENT_PLAN.md for recommendations.

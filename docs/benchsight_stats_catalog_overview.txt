BENCHSIGHT STAT & MICROSTAT CATALOG – OVERVIEW
=============================================

This file summarizes the structure of the bigger stats catalog and how to talk about
each metric with another LLM or a human.

1) Categories
   ----------
   - Core counting stats:
     goals, assists, shots, shot attempts, passes, completions, turnovers, takeaways,
     blocks, penalties, hits, faceoffs, etc.

   - On‑ice context:
     score state, manpower, zone, home/away, shift IDs, running clock, period, game phase.

   - Possession / sequence stats:
     chains of events (linked_event_id), sequences across zones (sequence_index),
     plays without change of team possession (play_index), counter‑rush markers.

   - Rating‑aware stats:
     measure outcomes **relative to quality of teammates/competition**, using your
     dim_player.rating and on‑ice rosters.

   - Vision‑era / tracking stats (future):
     speed, acceleration, distance traveled, lane usage, spacing, pressure, xG models, etc.

2) For Each Metric (Pattern)
   -------------------------
   For every stat in the full catalog we define:
   - **ID**: short stable code, e.g. `EV_SHOTS_FOR`, `EV_CORSI_FOR`, `MS_ZONE_ENTRY_CARRY`.
   - **Name**: readable name, e.g. “Even‑Strength Shots For”.
   - **Context / grain**: player / team / line; per game / season / shift / event.
   - **Definition**: English explanation.
   - **Formula sketch**: SQL/pseudocode using your tables:
     * `fact_events_long`, `fact_events_wide`,
     * `fact_shifts_long`, `fact_shifts_wide`,
     * `fact_boxscore_stats`, `dim_player`, `dim_team`, etc.
   - **Filter context**: strength state, score state, period, event types, etc.
   - **Data requirements**: what fields must exist (e.g. event_successful, xy coords).
   - **Status**: AVAILABLE NOW / FUTURE WHEN TRACKING EXISTS / REQUIRES VISION.

3) Using With Other LLMs
   ---------------------
   - You can paste the full catalog text into another LLM and say:
     “Here are my stat definitions. Please write SQL or DAX to compute
      `EV_CORSI_FOR` per player per game from these tables.”
   - Or: “Using this catalog, build a Power BI model with measures for all
     shot/attempt‑based stats and create a page layout like NHL Edge.”

For the full, detailed catalog (dozens of metrics with formulas and status),
see: `benchsight_stats_catalog_v4.txt` in this same folder.

## Career Path Analysis

### Your Fit by Role

## Commercial Viability Analysis

### Market Segmentation

| Segment | Size | Price Range | Viability | Verdict |
|---------|------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| Rec/Beer Leagues | 50,000+ teams | $100-200/yr | ❌ Not viable | No one will pay or track |
| Youth/Travel | 100,000 teams | $500-1,500/yr | ⚠️ Marginal | Hudl entrenched, long grind |
| Junior Hockey | ~300 teams | $5,000-15,000/yr | ✅ Viable | Best SaaS opportunity |
| College Hockey | ~150 programs | $5,000-20,000/yr | ⚠️ Hard | Hudl dominates |
| Pro (non-NHL) | ~200 teams | $20,000-50,000/yr | ✅ Viable | Need credibility |
| Agents/Scouts | 1,000+ | $500-10,000/yr | ⚠️ Niche | Add-on revenue |
| Consulting | Unlimited | $2,000-25,000/engagement | ✅ Most realistic | Low risk, start now |

### Revenue Potential by Path

| Path | Year 1 | Year 3 | Year 5 | Risk |
|------|--------|--------|--------|------|
| Keep job, side consulting | +$30-75K | +$50-100K | +$75-150K | Low |
| Full-time Junior/Pro focus | $50-150K | $300-600K | $500K-1M | High |
| Full-time Youth focus | $20-75K | $150-300K | $300-500K | Very High |
| Get better job | $130-160K | $160-200K | $200K+ | Very Low |

### The Hard Truth

**BenchSight as a venture-scale startup:** No. The market is too small, sales cycles too long, competition too established.

**BenchSight as a lifestyle business:** Maybe. With 3-5 years of full-time grinding on junior/college market, could build a $300-500K/year business. But you'd make less than a job for years.

**BenchSight as consulting launchpad:** Yes. Could realistically generate $50-150K/year in side income while keeping your day job.

**BenchSight as career leverage:** Absolutely yes. This is its highest and best use. Can get you a $40K+ raise immediately.

### What Would Change This Assessment

- Deep relationships in junior/college hockey (sales channel)
- Willingness to make $50K or less for 3 years while building
- $200K+ in savings to self-fund the grind
- A strategic partner wanting to fund/support you
- Tracking solution that scales (CV or integration)
- Doing this regardless of financial outcome

---

## Recommendations

### Primary Recommendation: Dual Track Strategy

**Track A: Get a Better Job (Months 1-3)**
1. Deploy BenchSight publicly
2. Update resume for Senior BA / Solutions Engineer / Technical PM
3. Apply to 10-15 roles
4. Target $120-150K

**Track B: Build AI Credibility (Months 1-6)**
1. Add LLM features to BenchSight
2. Add RAG system
3. Learn prompt engineering and evals
4. Position for AI PM roles at $150K+

### Why This Works
- Track A gets you immediate income boost with low risk
- Track B builds toward higher-paying roles
- BenchSight becomes portfolio piece for both
- If you take a Track A job, you keep building toward Track B
- If consulting opportunities emerge, take them

### What NOT to Do

❌ Don't quit your job to build BenchSight full-time
❌ Don't target rec leagues (no money there)
❌ Don't spend 12 months grinding LeetCode before applying
❌ Don't position BenchSight as a startup in job interviews

### What TO Do

✅ Get BenchSight deployed publicly (this weekend)
✅ Record a 3-minute demo video
✅ Apply to Senior BA and Solutions Engineer roles immediately
✅ Add one AI feature over the next month
✅ Consider consulting engagements if they emerge

BENCHSIGHT STATS CATALOG V4 (CONDENSED FOR LLM USE)
===================================================

NOTE: This is a condensed version for this environment. The intent is to show the
structure and representative examples across categories.

1. CORE EVENT STATS
-------------------
ID: G
Name: Goals
Grain: player-game (also team-game, season aggregates)
Definition: Count of events where Type = 'shot' AND event_detail_1 = 'goal' AND event_player_1 = player.
Formula sketch (SQL):
    SELECT game_id, event_player_1 AS player_id, COUNT(*) AS G
    FROM   fact_events_long
    WHERE  type = 'shot'
      AND  event_detail_1 = 'goal'
      AND  event_player_1 IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY game_id, event_player_1;
Data requirements: fact_events_long with columns (game_id, type, event_detail_1, event_player_1).
Status: AVAILABLE NOW.

ID: SH
Name: Shots on Goal
Definition: Events where Type = 'shot' AND event_detail_1 IN ('on_goal','goal').
... (similarly structured)

ID: SA
Name: Shot Attempts
Definition: All 'shot' events (on goal, missed, blocked, post).

ID: PASS_CMP / PASS_ATT
Name: Completed Passes / Pass Attempts
Definition: Events with Type = 'pass'; completed if event_successful = 1.

ID: TO / TK
Name: Turnovers / Takeaways
Definition: Based on event_type / event_detail mapping table (dim_event_type) and which side is credited.

2. ON-ICE CONTEXT / POSSESSION
------------------------------
ID: CF / CA
Name: Corsi For / Against
Definition: Shot attempts (SA) for or against while player is on ice.
Formula sketch:
    - Join fact_events_long (shots) to fact_shifts_long_on_ice using game_id, period, running time,
      and team_side to determine which players are on ice.
    - CF: SA where player's team = shooting team.
    - CA: SA where player's team != shooting team.

ID: FF / FA
Name: Fenwick For / Against
Definition: Like Corsi, but excludes blocked shots.

ID: OZ_ENTRY_W_CARRY
Name: Controlled Zone Entries with Carry
Definition: Events with Type='zone_entry' AND event_detail_1='carry' credited to event_player_1.

ID: OZ_EXIT_W_CONTROL
Name: Controlled Zone Exits
Definition: Type='zone_exit' AND event_detail_1='control' (no turnover) etc.

ID: PLAY_CHAIN_XG
Name: Expected Goals per Play Chain
Definition: In future, each play_index chain gets an expected goal probability based on sequence
            of actions, zone, player roles, ratings, and xy features.
Data requirements: Complete chain tables (fact_event_chain, fact_play_chain), plus trained xG model.
Status: FUTURE VISION.

3. RATING-AWARE / MATCHUP STATS
-------------------------------
ID: QoC_EXP
Name: Expected Quality of Competition
Definition: Average opponent rating (dim_player.rating) for players on ice vs a given player.

ID: QoT_EXP
Name: Expected Quality of Teammates
Definition: Average teammate rating on ice with the player.

ID: RATING_ADJ_CF60
Name: Rating-Adjusted Corsi per 60
Definition: CF60 adjusted for QoC and QoT using regression or a simple correction factor.
Status: FUTURE (requires modeling step).

4. VISION-ERA STATS (FUTURE DATA)
---------------------------------
ID: TOP_SPEED
Name: Top Skating Speed
Data: Player tracking positions at 25 Hz; derive max distance/time window.

ID: ACCEL_MAX, DECEL_MAX
Name: Max Acceleration / Deceleration
Data: Differenced speed series from tracking.

ID: ROUTE_EFFICIENCY
Name: Route Efficiency on Rush
Definition: Straight-line distance from DZ → OZ entry vs actual path distance.

ID: PRESSURE_SHOT
Name: Shot Under Pressure
Definition: Whether nearest defender within X feet at time of shot.

[...] (more metrics omitted for brevity, but follow same pattern)

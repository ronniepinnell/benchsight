BENCHSIGHT FEATURE BACKLOG & ROADMAP (SHORT / MID / LONG)
========================================================

SHORT TERM (0–3 months) – TEAM & RESUME
---------------------------------------
Goals:
  - Have a stable ETL + datamart.
  - Produce meaningful reports for your team.
  - Have a project that looks great on a resume / portfolio.

Key Features:
  - Clean project structure: src/, sql/, data/, docs/, powerbi/, tracker/.
  - One main orchestrator Python script (e.g., run_benchsight.py) with menu:
      * Stage/refresh BLB master tables.
      * Ingest new game folders (manual tracker).
      * Rebuild datamart tables for all games.
      * Export datamart tables as CSV for Power BI.
  - Power BI model with:
      * Game summary page (ESPN/NHL style).
      * Player card page (NHL Edge inspired).
      * Line combo / head-to-head pages.
      * Season overview page (trends over time).
  - Basic Python dashboard (Dash/Streamlit) that mirrors key PBI pages.
  - Core stats from the catalog: G, A, SOG, CF/CA, FF/FA, TOI, shift counts, zone entry/exit, etc.

MID TERM (3–12 months) – BENCH TOOL / LIGHT COMMERCIAL
------------------------------------------------------
Goals:
  - Make tracking faster and more pleasant.
  - Turn the system into something a whole team or club can use.

Key Features:
  - Web-based tracker UI:
      * Login / multi-team support.
      * Roster selection from dim_player and fact_game_roster.
      * Event entry form with dependent dropdowns (like Excel Lists tab).
      * Integrated XY clicker for rink & net (events and shots).
      * Shift logging, with auto-on/off, copy last line, etc.
  - Per-game logging QA:
      * fact_game_tracking_coverage summarizing what’s tracked (shifts/events/xy/video) and which time ranges.
      * Automated data quality logs (missing players, weird durations, bad clock values).
  - Simple subscription-ready structure:
      * Multi-tenant database or schema-per-league.
      * The ability to invite multiple users and control which teams they see.

LONG TERM (1–3 years) – VISION PLATFORM & PRO USE
-------------------------------------------------
Goals:
  - Reduce manual tracking using computer vision.
  - Offer pro-level insights (xG/xPlay, route analysis, etc.).

Key Features:
  - Vision pipeline:
      * Video ingestion (YouTube or uploaded MP4).
      * Pose / tracking model integration (e.g., OpenCV + DeepSORT + domain-specific models).
      * Data alignment between tracking and events (time-coded by running seconds).
  - xG and xPlay models:
      * Train models on your own data + possibly public NHL data (e.g., MoneyPuck) where permitted.
      * Surface these in dashboards, reports, and scouting tools.
  - Bench/iPad UI with live-like feedback:
      * Simple scoreboard, next shift suggestions, mismatches to exploit, etc.

VERY LONG TERM (3+ years) – ECOSYSTEM
-------------------------------------
  - White-label version for multiple sports (soccer, lacrosse, basketball).
  - Public APIs for third-party apps.
  - Marketplace for custom models and analytics packages.

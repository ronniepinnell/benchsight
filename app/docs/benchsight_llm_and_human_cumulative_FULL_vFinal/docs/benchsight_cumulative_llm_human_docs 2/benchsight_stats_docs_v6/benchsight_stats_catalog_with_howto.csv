BS01,Goals,Player-Game / Player-Season / Team-Game,Count of events where event_type = 'shot' AND event_detail_1 = 'goal' for event_player_1.,"fact_events_long[event_type, event_detail_1, event_player_1_id], dim_player, dim_game","Usually 5v5 or all strengths; filter by season, team, or game as needed.",Core scoring stat; combine with TOI and game state to interpret usage vs efficiency.,"If a player has 2 goals in a game, they directly finished two scoring plays. Over a season, compare goals to shot volume and role (PP vs EV) to judge finishing ability."
BS02,Primary Assists,Player-Game / Player-Season,Count of shot events with event_detail_1 = 'goal' AND play_details_1 = 'primary_assist' for the credited passer.,"fact_events_long[event_type, event_detail_1, play_details_1, event_player_1_id], dim_player",Same strength filters as goals; often split into EV and PP.,Captures the last pass before a goal; strong proxy for playmaking.,High primary assists means this player is often the one making the final pass that creates goals. Compare to secondary assists and shots to see if they drive offense as a passer or shooter.
BS03,Secondary Assists,Player-Game / Player-Season,Count of shot events with event_detail_1 = 'goal' AND play_details_2 = 'secondary_assist'.,"fact_events_long[event_type, event_detail_1, play_details_2, event_player_1_id], dim_player",Similar to goals/primary assists.,More context-dependent than primary assists; can benefit from bounces and chaos plays.,"Secondary assists show involvement earlier in the play. A high number can still signal good puck movement and support, but is noisier than primary assists."
BS04,Points,Player-Game / Player-Season,Goals + Primary Assists + Secondary Assists.,"fact_player_boxscore[goals, primary_assists, secondary_assists]","Interpret per TOI, per game, and by situation (EV, PP, PK).",Traditional counting stat; hides rate differences and deployment.,Points summarize boxscore offense. A player with many points but low TOI is highly efficient; many points with huge TOI might reflect usage more than dominance.
BS05,Shots on Goal,Player-Game / Player-Season / Team-Game,"Count of events where event_type = 'shot' AND event_detail_1 IN ('shot_on_goal', 'goal').","fact_events_long[event_type, event_detail_1, event_player_1_id]",Often filtered to 5v5 for comparability across teams.,Ignores missed and blocked attempts; more conservative than Corsi/Fenwick.,Think of this as 'pucks that reached the goalie or net'. High shots on goal usually mean the player generates a lot of direct pressure.
BS06,Shot Attempts (Corsi Events),On-Ice Player-Game / Team-Game,"For a shooter: all events where event_type = 'shot'. For on-ice metrics, sum all shot events for the player’s team while they are on the ice.","fact_events_long, fact_onice_events[shooting_team_id, onice_player_id]","Commonly 5v5, score- and venue-adjusted in advanced models.",Corsi For (CF) and Corsi Against (CA) are the building blocks of many possession metrics.,"If CF% is 60%, your team takes 60% of all shot attempts while this player is on the ice. Values above ~50% mean the ice is tilted in your favor during their shifts."
BS07,Unblocked Shot Attempts (Fenwick Events),On-Ice Player-Game / Team-Game,Shot attempts excluding blocked shots (event_detail_1 <> 'blocked_shot').,"fact_events_long, fact_onice_events[event_detail_1]",Same as Corsi; often used as a better proxy for expected goals than pure Corsi.,"Closer proxy to dangerous pressure, since blocked shots rarely become goals.","High Fenwick For and Fenwick% show that when this player is out there, your team is generating unblocked pressure towards the net."
BS08,Plus-Minus,On-Ice Player-Game / Player-Season,Even-strength goals for while on ice minus even-strength goals against while on ice.,"fact_onice_events[event_type, event_detail_1, strength_state, shooting_team_id, onice_team_id]","Even strength only, typically 5v5. Often exclude empty-net situations.",Highly context- and teammate-dependent; noisy over small samples.,"Plus-minus is more useful over long samples and in tandem with usage (TOI, QoC, QoT). Negative over a short stretch isn’t automatically bad; look at expected goals and matchups."
BS09,Time on Ice (TOI Seconds),Player-Game / Player-Period / Player-Season,Sum of shift_duration_seconds from fact_shifts_long for each player/game (or period).,"fact_shifts_long[player_id, game_id, shift_duration_seconds]",Can be split by EV/PP/PK by filtering on strength fields.,Key context stat; many other metrics are best interpreted as per-60 rates relative to TOI.,Think of TOI as your 'ice budget'. Players with heavy minutes are trusted; pairing TOI with rates like CF/60 or Points/60 shows efficiency under that workload.
BS10,Time on Ice (TOI Minutes),Player-Game / Player-Period / Player-Season,toi_seconds / 60.,fact_player_boxscore[toi_seconds],Same as TOI seconds.,Just a more interpretable unit for coaches and broadcasts.,15–18 EV minutes for a forward often means top-six usage; 22–25 minutes for a defenseman signals top-pair deployment.
BS11,Corsi For % (CF%),On-Ice Player-Game / Player-Season / Team-Game,CF% = CF / (CF + CA).,"fact_player_boxscore[corsi_for, corsi_against] or equivalent from on-ice table",Usually 5v5 score-adjusted to compare across teams and states.,Possession proxy; correlates with future goal differential better than raw goal stats.,"Over many games, CF% above ~52–53% suggests positive territorial impact. A player with 60% CF over a season is almost constantly tilting the ice in your favor."
BS12,Fenwick For % (FF%),On-Ice Player-Game / Player-Season / Team-Game,FF% = FF / (FF + FA).,"fact_player_boxscore[fenwick_for, fenwick_against]",Similar to CF%; sometimes used as a closer proxy to expected goals.,"Removes blocked shots, so it tracks unblocked danger better than CF%.",FF% tells you what share of unblocked attempts go in your favor with this player on the ice. It’s a strong 'who is driving play' signal over big samples.
BS13,Corsi For per 60 (CF/60),On-Ice Player-Game / Player-Season,CF/60 = 60 * CF / TOI_minutes.,"fact_player_boxscore[corsi_for, toi_seconds], dim_player",Usually restricted to 5v5; compare players with similar roles.,Rate version of CF; lets you compare players with different TOI.,"If Player A has 65 CF/60 and Player B has 50 CF/60 in similar roles, A drives more shot volume per minute. High CF/60 with tough matchups is especially impressive."
BS14,Fenwick For per 60 (FF/60),On-Ice Player-Game / Player-Season,FF/60 = 60 * FF / TOI_minutes.,"fact_player_boxscore[fenwick_for, toi_seconds]",Same as CF/60.,Better aligned with dangerous chances than CF/60 in many models.,High FF/60 indicates the player is on the ice for a lot of unblocked attempts per minute—think sustained pressure and chaos near the net.
BS15,Points per 60 (P/60),Player-Season / Player-Game (for context),P/60 = 60 * Points / TOI_minutes.,"fact_player_boxscore[points, toi_seconds]","Commonly at 5v5, plus separate P/60 for PP usage.",Key efficiency stat; heavily used in player comps and contract evaluation.,A player with 2.5+ P/60 at 5v5 is elite offensively. Comparing P/60 with CF/60 can differentiate volume shooters from playmakers and finishers.
BS16,Rating-Adjusted Corsi For per 60,On-Ice Player-Season / Player-Game (larger samples work better),AdjCF/60 = CF/60 * (OppAvgRating / BaselineRating).,"fact_player_boxscore[corsi_for, toi_seconds], fact_onice_rating_context[opp_avg_rating], dim_player[rating]",Typically 5v5; rating model must be stable.,Attempts to credit players more when they drive play vs tough competition and discount when they feast on weak opponents.,"If two players both have 55 CF/60, but one faced much tougher opponents (higher OppAvgRating), the rating-adjusted CF/60 will highlight that tougher deployment."

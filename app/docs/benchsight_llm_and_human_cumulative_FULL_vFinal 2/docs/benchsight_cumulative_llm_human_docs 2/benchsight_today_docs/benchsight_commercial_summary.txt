BENCHSIGHT COMMERCIAL SUMMARY (HIGH LEVEL)
=========================================

1) Core Idea
   ----------
   BenchSight is a “Moneyball for beer league and junior hockey” platform:
   - You manually (or semi‑automatically) track detailed events and shifts.
   - The system combines that with league boxscore data and ratings.
   - It produces NHL‑style advanced stats, microstats, and visual reports for:
     * individual players
     * lines / pairings
     * full teams
     * head‑to‑head matchups over time.

2) Audience Ladder
   ----------------
   - **Phase 1 – Your team / league**: prove value with your own games.
   - **Phase 2 – Local/junior clubs**: white‑glove onboarding, simple subscription.
   - **Phase 3 – Regional/national**: more automation, APIs, and self‑serve dashboards.
   - **Phase 4 – Pro**: computer vision, full data pipeline, custom models, on‑site support.

3) Monetization
   ------------
   - Tiered subscriptions:
     * Team tier: few hundred $/season for full analytics + support.
     * Club tier: bundle multiple teams; higher price.
     * League tier: per‑team pricing or flat league deal.
   - Services / consulting:
     * custom reports
     * player scouting dossiers
     * draft / roster consulting.

4) Differentiation
   ----------------
   - Depth of tracking: microstats that most leagues cannot see.
   - Flexibility: works with **fully tracked games** and **boxscore‑only games**.
   - Storytelling: ESG / NHL‑style summaries, player cards, line matchup dashboards.
   - Roadmap toward **computer‑vision powered auto‑tracking**.

5) Tech / Data Stack (Conceptual)
   -------------------------------
   - Storage: Postgres (or cloud DB) + parquet/CSV snapshots.
   - ETL: Python (pandas + SQLAlchemy), modular src/ package.
   - Tracking: web UI (FastAPI/Flask backend + React/Vue front‑end) or Dash/Streamlit MVP.
   - Analytics: Power BI + Python dashboards (Plotly, Dash, etc.).
   - ML (later): Pytorch/TensorFlow + tracking data to learn xG/xPlay models.

6) Key Risks / Hurdles
   --------------------
   - Manual tracking load: must make the UI extremely fast and low‑click.
   - Data quality: logs & QA to flag inconsistent events or missing data.
   - Legal/IP: for pro content you’d need licensing or use public/partner feeds.
   - Distribution: selling into clubs and leagues is a **relationship** business.

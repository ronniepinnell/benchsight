BS01,Goals,"Player-Game, Player-Season, Team-Game",Count of events where event_type = 'shot' AND event_detail_1 = 'goal' AND player is event_player_1,"fact_events_long: event_type, event_detail_1, event_player_1_id, game_id",Filter by game_id and player_id for player-game; sum over games for season,Only credit shooter (event_player_1); own-goals handled as goals for scoring team.
BS02,Primary Assists,"Player-Game, Player-Season",Count of goal events where play_details_1 = 'primary_assist' AND player is event_player_1,"fact_events_long: event_type, event_detail_1, play_details_1, event_player_1_id, game_id",Same game and player filters as goals.,Assumes tracking sheet encodes primary assist explicitly in play_details_1.
BS03,Secondary Assists,"Player-Game, Player-Season",Count of goal events where play_details_2 = 'secondary_assist' AND player is event_player_1,"fact_events_long: event_type, event_detail_1, play_details_2, event_player_1_id, game_id",Same context as primary assists.,"If league scoring uses different fields, adjust mapping."
BS04,Points,"Player-Game, Player-Season",Goals + Primary Assists + Secondary Assists,"Derived from BS01, BS02, BS03",Same context as goals and assists.,Can be computed in SQL or as a DAX measure; conceptually simple sum.
BS05,Shots on Goal (SOG),"Player-Game, Team-Game","Count of shot events with event_detail_1 in ('shot_on_goal','goal') where player is event_player_1","fact_events_long: event_type, event_detail_1, event_player_1_id, game_id",Filter on shooter and game; team aggregation by team_id.,Separates SOG from misses and blocks; used in SH%.
BS06,Shot Attempts (Corsi),"On-Ice Player-Game, Team-Game","Count of events with event_type IN ('shot','goal') for any on-ice player (from shifts) regardless of block/miss/goal","fact_events_long, fact_shifts_long: event_type, team_id, on_ice_player_ids, game_id",Corsi For: events where on-ice team = shooting team; Against: shooting team is opponent.,Requires joining events to on-ice players via shift_index or time.
BS07,Unblocked Attempts (Fenwick),"On-Ice Player-Game, Team-Game",Like Corsi but excluding blocked_shot event_detail_1 values,"fact_events_long, fact_shifts_long: event_type, event_detail_1, team_id, on_ice_player_ids, game_id",Same as Corsi but filter out blocks.,Used as better proxy for shot quality than Corsi in some models.
BS08,Plus-Minus,"Player-Game, Player-Season",Goals For while on ice at even-strength minus Goals Against while on ice at even-strength,"fact_events_long (goals), fact_shifts_long (on-ice players, strength), dim_strength",Only even-strength or configurable strength states.,Can exclude EN or PP/PK situations depending on philosophy.
BS09,"Time on Ice (TOI, seconds)","Player-Game, Player-Period, Player-Season","Sum(shift_end_time - shift_start_time) per player, optionally minus stoppage_time","fact_shifts_long: player_id, game_id, period, shift_start_running, shift_end_running, stoppage_time","Per game, per period, or aggregated across games.",You can track raw TOI and stoppage-adjusted TOI as separate stats.
BS10,Controlled Zone Entries,"Player-Game, Team-Game",Count of events where event_type = 'zone_entry' AND event_detail_1 = 'controlled' AND player is event_player_1,"fact_events_long: event_type, event_detail_1, event_player_1_id, zone, game_id",Usually offensive-zone entries only.,Can split carry-in vs pass-in using play_details_*.
BS11,Controlled Zone Exits,"Player-Game, Team-Game",Count of events where event_type = 'zone_exit' AND event_detail_1 = 'controlled' AND player is event_player_1,"fact_events_long: event_type, event_detail_1, event_player_1_id, zone, game_id",Defensive-zone exits only.,Pair with failed exits to get success rates.
BS12,Giveaways (Clean),"Player-Game, Team-Game",Count of events tagged as turnover/giveaway that are NOT dumps/clears and NOT shot misses,"fact_events_long: event_type, event_detail_1, play_details_1/2, event_successful, event_player_1_id",Filter by event tags and exclude cleared categories.,Matches your requirement to isolate 'true' misplays from tactical dumps/clears.
BS13,Takeaways / Forced Turnovers,Player-Game,"Count of events where a defensive action directly causes a loss of possession, credited to event_player_1","fact_events_long: event_type, event_detail_1, play_details_1, event_player_1_id",Event taxonomy should distinguish forced vs unforced giveaways.,You may refine using chain/sequence context.
BS14,Rating-Adjusted Corsi For per 60,"Player-Game, Player-Season",60 * (CorsiFor_onIce / TOI_minutes) adjusted by average opponent_onIce_rating,"fact_events_onice, fact_shifts_long, dim_player.rating, dim_game","Even-strength, non-empty-net, configurable score states.",Opp_onIce_rating_avg can come from your rating context tables.
BS15,Sequence xG Contribution,"Player-Game, Sequence-Level","Sum of xG for all shots in sequences where player appears as a key event actor, divided by #sequences","fact_sequences, fact_events_long (with xG), fact_onice_players",Filter sequences by team or game as needed.,Requires you to compute/ingest xG and sequence tables.
BS16,Rush Chances,"Player-Game, Team-Game",Count of shots/goals within N seconds of controlled OZ entry by same team/line,"fact_events_long with timestamps, sequence_index/play_index, fact_shifts_long",Configurable windows e.g. 5 seconds post-entry.,Key concept for modern xThreat style models.

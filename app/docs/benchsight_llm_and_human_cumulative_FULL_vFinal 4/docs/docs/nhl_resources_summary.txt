Benchsight – NHL Analytics Resource Summary
==========================================

This document summarizes key NHL analytics resources and how they map into the Benchsight / BLB project.

1. MoneyPuck (play-by-play + xG)
   - Role: Primary public source for NHL play-by-play and shot-level expected goals data.
   - Use: Train and validate BLB xG, xA, and goalie models; derive league-average benchmarks for shot quality,
     rebound rates, rush vs cycle shots, etc.

2. Evolving-Hockey (WAR, RAPM, contracts)
   - Role: High-level impact metrics (WAR/GAR, RAPM) and contract models for NHL players.
   - Use: Conceptual template for future BLB impact models; helps you reason about how to move from microstats
     to value metrics that coaches and GMs care about.

3. Natural Stat Trick (shot-based team/player stats)
   - Role: Public Corsi, Fenwick, scoring chances, and high-danger stats.
   - Use: Canonical definitions of shot attempts, chances, danger tiers, and score/zone/strength buckets. Your
     BLB shot and chance metrics should follow the same spirit so that BLB vs NHL numbers are interpretable.

4. All Three Zones (microstats)
   - Role: Hand-tracked zone entry/exit and passing microstats.
   - Use: Prototype for your own BLB microstat schema and visualizations. If you can compute similar columns,
     you can say "this BLB player profiles like X NHL player in Corey Sznajder’s tracking."

5. HockeyViz (visualization + xG philosophy)
   - Role: Best-in-class rink/net visual layouts and isolated impact charts.
   - Use: Inspiration for Power BI and Dash layouts (shot maps, heatmaps, threat maps) and how to present
     player impacts in a coach-friendly way.

6. NHL EDGE (tracking-style metrics)
   - Role: Official tracking stats like speed, zone time, shot velocity.
   - Use: Long-term target for your CV/ML work: start with a minimal subset such as top speed, distance skated,
     and rush-vs-cycle tags, then approximate EDGE-like tiles for BLB players.

7. Hockey-Reference (historical context)
   - Role: Traditional season/game stats and franchise history.
   - Use: Season-level context for normalization and story-telling ("this player is on pace for top-10 BLB
     season by points per game", etc.).

8. hockeyR + open xG repos
   - Role: Open-source code for scraping NHL APIs and building xG models.
   - Use: Code reference for designing your own Python/Postgres pipelines and feature sets (shot angle, distance,
     rebounds, pre-shot movement).

9. NHL API community docs (dword4, others)
   - Role: Endpoint list for official NHL stats feeds.
   - Use: Direct ingestion of NHL schedules, games, rosters, and play-by-play into your raw/stage schema for
     large-scale model training.

10. Educational blogs (War on Ice, JetsNation, etc.)
    - Role: Conceptual explanations of Corsi/Fenwick/score effects and xG.
    - Use: Training material for human users and prompts for LLMs so they understand the intended definitions.

11. Kaggle NHL datasets
    - Role: Quick-start ML datasets for experimentation.
    - Use: Fast place to test new model ideas (clustering, player comps) before wiring them into your main system.
